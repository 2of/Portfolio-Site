# üöÄ My Portfolio Site

[![GitHub Pages](https://img.shields.io/website?down_color=red&down_message=offline&up_color=green&up_message=live&url=https%3A%2F%2F2of.github.io%2FPortfolio-Site%2F)](https://2of.github.io/Portfolio-Site/)

Welcome to my portfolio site ‚Äî a project that started out simple but spiraled into something a lot more complex (in a fun way). It's still a **work in progress**, but it's **live**, it's **React-based**, and it's already hosting articles and tools.

### üîó Check it out:
üåê **Live site:** [2of.io](https://2of.io)  
üìÑ **Example article:** [2of.io/#/proj/geo](https://2of.io/#/proj/geo)

---

## üõ†Ô∏è What's in the box?

- üß† A custom JSON format for embedding articles, data, images, and other structured content  
- üìù A basic article editor (accessible via **/settings ‚Üí Open Editor**)  
- üß© ~60% of a reusable UI component library (you‚Äôll spot the patterns!)  
- üì¶ All built with React, using SCSS for styling and a handful of custom hooks/context

---

## ‚úçÔ∏è Why?

Started off just wanting to host my thesis and a few projects‚Ä¶  
Now it‚Äôs a mini CMS with its own JSON structure and editing interface. Whoops.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Current TODOs

- [ ] Refactor article handling to use a reducer  
- [ ] Fix Firefox column rendering issues  
- [ ] Fix Safari iOS 16+ padding bug  
- [ ] File open bugs as GitHub issues

---

##  Notes

I wanted to learn react, so here we go. 

## Responsive

It's a fully responsive site, the mobile view is ~tiktok inspired.


## Scss + REACT + JS ... 

It's also a little Loosey-goosey (it's a personal site) so there's not much in the way of interfaces or types or such. Likewise not much in the way of comments and it's pretty loosely organized


## üìå Main Things

- **`routes.jsx`**  
  Handles page routing, including background setup and page loading behavior.

- **`metadata.json`**  
  - Contains metadata for everything shown on `/projects` (aside from external API content).  
  - Includes references to the full `text.json` files for each article/write-up.  
  - Manually maintained.

- **Article handling**  
  - Articles can be loaded from local or external sources.  
  - The app checks for valid JSON and type safety before rendering.  
  - If there's an issue, it logs the error but fails gracefully ‚Äî nothing breaks.

- **Assets**  
  All images are sourced from Unsplash or other open domain resources.

- **Responsive design**  
  Looks **best on mobile** right now ‚Äî desktop styling is in progress.

Yeah, that's all! (It's not there's oodles of things in there)





## Chrome (Happy) Webkit (mostly happy) Firefox (Very upset and causing me headaches)
You might see bugs in FF

# It's a lot more complex than it looks.
There's a bunch of fancy contexts, react portals, providers and middleware in there. 

There's a whole markup language defined for the 'articles' in /projects (and also on the homepage)




#### Data is therefore just popped into /src/assets (not public) gh pages is enough of a repo to not bother hosting elsewhere

best way to convert text to the schema is using an LLM
